# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Game, a classic two-player game built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases a responsive web-based implementation where players take turns marking 'X' or 'O' on a 3x3 grid, with features to detect wins, draws, and reset the game.


## Project Overview
This repository contains a simple yet fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game designed as a personal project to demonstrate web development skills. The game is lightweight, mobile-friendly, and hosted on GitHub Pages for easy access.


## Features
Two-Player Gameplay: Players alternate turns as 'X' and 'O'.
Win Detection: Automatically identifies a winner with three matching symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
Draw Detection: Declares a draw when the board is full with no winner.
Reset Functionality: Allows players to start a new game with a single click.
Responsive Design: Adapts to desktop and mobile screens with a clean, user-friendly interface.
Hover Effects: Visual feedback on cell hover for better user interaction.


## Technologies Used
HTML5: Structures the game board and UI elements.
CSS3: Styles the grid layout, adds responsiveness, and includes hover effects.
JavaScript: Handles game logic, event handling, win/draw detection, and reset functionality.
Git: Version control for managing project changes.
GitHub: Hosting the repository and enabling GitHub Pages deployment.


## How to Run Locally
$$
Clone the Repository:
$$
Open your terminal and run:git clone [https://github.com/Harikrishna59/tic-tac-toe.git]
$$
Navigate to the Project Folder:
$$
Change to the project directory:
cd tic-tac-toe
$$
Open the Game:
$$
Open `index.html` in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) by double-clicking the file or using a live server extension in VS Code.
Alternatively, use a local server:
Install the Live Server extension in VS Code.
Right-click `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server."

## Live Demo
[Coming Soon - Check back after GitHub Pages deployment] Update this link after setting up GitHub Pages, e.g., (https://github.com/Harika459/tic-tac-toe)

## Installation and Setup
No additional dependencies or installations are required. The game runs directly in any modern web browser. For development, ensure you have:
A code editor (e.g., VS Code).
Git installed for version control.
A web browser for testing.


## Future Improvements
AI Opponent: Implement a single-player mode with a basic AI using the minimax algorithm.
Score Tracking: Add a scoreboard to track wins for X and O.
Animations: Include CSS animations for cell clicks or win highlights.
Multiplayer Online: Explore WebSocket integration for online play.
Unit Tests: Add JavaScript tests using a framework like Jest.
